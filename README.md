# Data Preparation

##  1. Data Exploration and Column Selection
   - First, I thoroughly examined the dataset, assessing each column to identify key variables essential for future dashboard creation.

##  2. Data Cleansing and Error Identification
   - Implemented filters on each column header to detect and rectify erroneous data entries and identify potential duplicates within the dataset.

## 3. Duplicate Removal
   - Eliminated duplicate entries across the entire dataset to ensure data integrity and accuracy.

# Data Formatting and Standardization

## 1. Standardizing Categorical Data
   - Addressed categorical columns like 'Marital Status' and 'Gender', replacing abbreviations (e.g., M, F, S) with full words for clarity and consistency.

## 2. Numeric Data Formatting
   - Formatted income values to a generalized numerical format suitable for seamless database integration.

## 3. Age Grouping for Dashboard Clarity
   - Recognizing the importance of the 'Age' column, I categorized individual ages into meaningful groups using an 'Age Bracket' column. This categorization enhances visualization clarity in dashboards.

# Dashboard Creation and Visualization

## 1. Pivot Tables and Visualizations
   - Employed pivot tables to organize and summarize data, facilitating the creation of insightful visualizations for the dashboard.

## 2. Interactive Dashboard Features
   - Enhanced dashboard usability by incorporating slicers, enabling viewers to dynamically filter and explore visualizations based on specific criteria of interest.
